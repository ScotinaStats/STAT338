# Multiple Random Variables

So far, we have looked at a **single random variable**, *Y*. 

- The distribution of *Y* provides *complete information* about **probabilities** associated with *Y*. 

But in many applications, we care about the relationship between **multiple random variables** in the same experiment!

<br>

**Joint/Multivariate distributions** allow us to learn about how multiple random variables are related, by studying the probability distribution associated with the *intersection* of multiple random variables: $$(Y_{1}=y_{1}),(Y_{2}=y_{2}),\dots,(Y_{n}=y_{n})$$

# Discrete Joint Distributions

**Example**

Suppose we make our way back to *Piéchart Casino* and play a game where we toss three *balanced* coins *independently* (no, this game isn't rigged):

- $X=$ number of heads

- $Y=\dots$
    - &#36;1 if first head is on toss 1
    - &#36;2 if first head is on toss 2
    - &#36;3 if first head is on toss 3
    - -&#36;1 if no heads
    
--

**Outcomes**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data.frame(Outcome = c("X", "Y"), HHH = c(3,1), THH = c(2,2), HTH = c(2,1), HHT = c(2,1), 
           TTH = c(1,3), THT = c(1,2), HTT = c(1,1), TTT = c(0,-1)) %>%
  gt() 
```

---

# Joint PMF

Let $X$ and $Y$ be **discrete** random variables. The **joint (bivariate) probability function** for $X$ and $Y$ is given by $$p(x,y)=P(X=x,Y=y).$$

--

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data.frame(Outcome = c("X", "Y"), HHH = c(3,1), THH = c(2,2), HTH = c(2,1), HHT = c(2,1), 
           TTH = c(1,3), THT = c(1,2), HTT = c(1,1), TTT = c(0,-1)) %>%
  gt() 
```

In the *Piéchart Casino* example, a visual of the joint PMF is given below:

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2, dpi = 300, out.width = "50%"}

  Y1 = sum(coin_toss)
  
  first_head = which(coin_toss == 1)[1]
  Y2 = case_when(
    first_head == 1 ~ 1,
    first_head == 2 ~ 2,
    first_head == 3 ~ 3,
    is.na(first_head) ~ -1
  )
  c(Y1, Y2)

# Joint PMF

Similar to the single variable (**univariate**) case, a *valid* PMF must be nonnegative and sum to 1. 

**Theorem**: If $X$ and $Y$ are discrete random variables with joint probability function $p(x,y)$, then...

1. $p(x,y)\geq 0$ for all $x,y$. 

2. $\sum_{x,y}p(x,y)=1$, where the sum is over all values $(x,y)$ that are assigned non-zero probabilities.

<br>

🤔 Is our PMF from the *Piéchart Casino* example a *valid* PMF?

# Joint Distribution Function

For any random variables $X$ and $Y$, the **joint (bivariate) distribution function**, $F(x,y)$, is $$F(x,y)=P(X\leq x, Y\leq y),\qquad -\infty<x<\infty,\ -\infty<y<\infty.$$

<br>

**Practice**

In the *Piéchart Casino* example, find $F(2,1)=P(X\leq2,Y\leq1)$.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data.frame(Outcome = c("X", "Y"), HHH = c(3,1), THH = c(2,2), HTH = c(2,1), HHT = c(2,1), 
           TTH = c(1,3), THT = c(1,2), HTT = c(1,1), TTT = c(0,-1)) %>%
  gt() 
```

---

# Joint Distribution Function

For any random variables $X$ and $Y$, the **joint (bivariate) distribution function**, $F(x,y)$, is $$F(x,y)=P(X\leq x, Y\leq y),\qquad -\infty<x<\infty,\ -\infty<y<\infty.$$

<br>

**Solution**

In the *Piéchart Casino* example, find $F(2,1)=P(X\leq2,Y\leq1)$.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data.frame(Outcome = c("X", "Y"), HHH = c(3,1), THH = c(2,2), HTH = c(2,1), HHT = c(2,1), 
           TTH = c(1,3), THT = c(1,2), HTT = c(1,1), TTT = c(0,-1)) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_style(
    style = list(
      cell_text(color = "black", weight = "bold"), 
      cell_fill(color = "dodgerblue", alpha = 0.2)
      ),
    locations = cells_body(
      columns = vars(HTH, HHT, HTT, TTT)) 
  )
```

\begin{align*}
P(X\leq2,Y\leq1)&=P(X=0,Y=-1)+P(X=1,Y=1)+P(X=2,Y=1)\\
&=\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{2}{8}\\
&=\frac{1}{2}
\end{align*}

# Continuous Joint Distributions

Let $X$ and $Y$ be **continuous** random variables with joint distribution function $F(x,y)$. If there exists a nonnegative function $f(x,y)$, such that $$F(x,y)=P(X\leq x, Y\leq y)=\int^{x}_{-\infty}\int^{y}_{-\infty}f(t_{1},t_{2})\,dt_{2}dt_{1},$$ for all $-\infty<x<\infty$, $-\infty<y<\infty$, then $X$ and $Y$ are **jointly continuous random variables**. 

- The function $f(x,y)$ is called the **joint probability density function (PDF)**. 

--

Similar to joint discrete random variables, if $X$ and $Y$ are jointly continuous, then...

1. $f(x,y)\geq0$ for all $x,y$. 

2. $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x,y)\,dxdy=1$

---

# Continuous Joint Probabilities

Let $X$ and $Y$ be **continuous** random variables with joint distribution function $F(x,y)$. If there exists a nonnegative function $f(x,y)$, such that $$F(x,y)=P(X\leq x, Y\leq y)=\int^{x}_{-\infty}\int^{y}_{-\infty}f(t_{1},t_{2})\,dt_{2}dt_{1},$$ for all $-\infty<x<\infty$, $-\infty<y<\infty$, then $X$ and $Y$ are **jointly continuous random variables**. 

- The function $f(x,y)$ is called the **joint probability density function (PDF)**. 

For two RVs $X$ and $Y$ with joint PDF $f(x,y)$, the *joint probability* $P(a_{1}\leq X\leq a_{2}, b_{1}\leq Y\leq b_{2})$ is $$P(a_{1}\leq X\leq a_{2}, b_{1}\leq Y\leq b_{2})=\int_{b_{1}}^{b_{2}}\int_{a_{1}}^{a_{2}}f(x,y)\,dxdy$$

- Find $P(X>0.5, Y<0.5)$.

1. Show that $P(Y_{1}+Y_{2}<3)=1-4e^{-3}=0.8009$. 

2. Find $P(Y_{1}<1, Y_{2}>5)$.

    - &#36;2 if first head is on toss 2
    - &#36;3 if first head is on toss 3

What if we only wanted to find a probability *associated with X*, such as $P(X = 2)$?

- To find the distribution of *X* **alone**, we need to sum over *all possible values of Y*: $P(X=2)=p(2,-1)+p(2,1)+p(2,2)+p(2,3)$

# Marginal Probability Functions (Discrete)

# Marginal Probability Functions (Continuous)

For **continuous** random variables $X$ and $Y$, the **marginal probability functions** of $X$ and $Y$, respectively, are $$f_{X}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x,y)\,dy\qquad\text{and}\qquad f_{Y}(y)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x,y)\,dx.$$

# Practice

Let $X$ and $Y$ be random variables with joint probability density function $$f(x,y)=\begin{cases}x+y,&0<x<1,0<y<1\\0,&\text{elsewhere}.\end{cases}$$

- Find the marginal distribution for $X$, $f_{X}(x)$.

# Marginal Probability Functions (Continuous)

**Example**

Let $X$ and $Y$ be random variables with joint probability density function $$f(x,y)=\begin{cases}\frac{e^{-y}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-x^2/2},&-\infty<x<\infty,y>0\\0,&\text{elsewhere}.\end{cases}$$

- Find the marginal distributions $f_{X}(x)$ and $f_{Y}(y)$.

<br>

**Solution**

It turns out...

- $X\sim\text{Normal}(0,1)$

- $Y\sim\text{Exponential}(1)$

# Conditional Distributions

# Condtional Probability

Suppose we have two random variables, $X$ and $Y$. We *observe* some value of $X$, and we want to use this to *update* our distribution of $Y$ to reflect this information. 

- The **marginal distributions**, $P(Y=y)$ and $f_{Y}(y)$, do not take into account *any* information about $X$. 

<br>

--

**Recall** some properties of **conditional probabilities** that we studied previously:

- $P(A\mid B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$

- $P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B\mid A)=P(B)P(A\mid B)$

- $P(A\mid B)=\frac{P(B\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}$ (**Bayes' Rule**)

---

# Conditional Distributions

We can extend the properties of **conditional probability** to settings involving random variables!

**Discrete case**

If $X$ and $Y$ are jointly **discrete** random variables with *joint* probability function $p(x,y)$ and *marginal* probability functions $p_X(x)$ and $p_{Y}(y)$, respectively, then the **conditional probability function** of $X$ *given* $Y=y$ is: $$p(x\mid y)=P(X=x\mid Y=y)=\frac{P(X=x, Y=y)}{P(Y=y)}=\frac{p(x,y)}{p_{Y}(y)}$$

--

**Continuous case**

For **continuous** random variables $X$ and $Y$ with *joint* density function $f(x,y)$ and *marginal* density functions $f_{X}(x)$ and $f_{Y}(y)$, the **conditional density function** of $X$ *given* $Y=y$ is: $$f(x\mid y)=\frac{f(x,y)}{f_{Y}(y)}$$


---

# Practice

(WMS 5.25)

Let $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ have the joint probability density function $$f(y_{1},y_{2})=\begin{cases}e^{-(y_{1}+y_{2})},&y_{1}>0,y_{2}>0\\0,&\text{elsewhere}.\end{cases}$$

1. Find the marginal density function for $Y_{2}$, $f_{Y_{2}}(y_{2})$. 

2. For $y_{2}>0$, what is the conditional density function of $Y_{1}$ given that $Y_{2}=y_{2}$?

---

# Conditional Distributions (Continuous)

**Example** (WMS 5.31)

Let $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ have the joint probability density function $$f(y_{1},y_{2})=\begin{cases}30y_{1}y_{2}^{2},&y_{1}-1\leq y_{2}\leq 1-y_{1}, 0\leq y_{1}\leq 1\\0,&\text{elsewhere}.\end{cases}$$

1. Show that the marginal density of $Y_{1}$ is a beta density with $\alpha=2$ and $\beta=4$. 

2. Find the conditional density of $Y_{2}$ given $Y_{1}=y_{1}$. Use this to show that $P(Y_{2}>0\mid Y_{1}=0.75)=0.5$.

# The Beta-Binomial Conjugacy

**The story**

Suppose we are tossing a **biased coin**, but we don't know *how* biased it is. 

- In other words, it lands Heads with some *unknown* probability, $p$.

- We could *infer* the value of $p$ by tossing the coin a bunch of times. But that isn't **fun**...

--

**The Set-up**

Let's assign the $Beta(\alpha,\beta)$ distribution to the *unknown* $p$. 

- That is, $p\sim\text{Beta}(\alpha,\beta)$. 

Let $Y$ be the number of Heads in $n$ tosses of the coin. 

- This **depends on** $p$, so we would write: $$Y\mid p\sim\text{Binomial}(n,p)$$

---

# The Beta-Binomial Conjugacy

To update the **prior distribution** of $p$ based on our "data" (*Y*), we use Bayes' Rule: $$f(p\mid Y=y)=\frac{P(Y=y\mid p)f(p)}{P(Y=y)}$$

--

We can write $P(Y=y\mid p)$ and $f(p)$ just by using the *Binomial* and *Beta* probability functions, but $P(Y=y)$ is a **marginal** probability function. 

- Using the $P(A\cap B)=P(A\mid B)P(B)$ property, we can calculate $$P(Y=y)=\int_{0}^{1}P(Y,p)\,dp=\int_{0}^{1}P(Y\mid p)f(p)\,dp.$$

# Independent Random Variables

# Independent Events

Two events are said to be **independent** if knowledge that one event occurs does not indicate whether the other event is more likely to occur. 

Formally, two events are **independent** if *any* one of the following holds:

- $P(A\mid B)=P(A)$

- $P(B\mid A)=P(B)$

- $P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)$

Otherwise, the events are said to be *dependent*. 

--

This was from the first month of class, but we can extend it to a setting involving *random variables*. 

- In fact, we've already seen joint distributions where...
    - the probabilities associated with $X$ depended on the observed value of $Y$
    - the probabilities associated with $X$ are completely independent of $Y$
    
---

# Independent Random Variables

The *technical* definition of **independence** involves *cumulative distribution functions*...

Let $X$ have distribution function $F_{X}(x)$, $Y$ have distribution function $F_{Y}(y)$, and $X$ and $Y$ have *joint* distribution function $F(x,y)$. Then $X$ and $Y$ are said to be **independent** if and only if $$F(x,y)=F_{X}(x)F_{Y}(y)=P(X\leq x)P(Y\leq y).$$ If $X$ and $Y$ are not independent, they are said to be **dependent**. 

--

<br>

This is equivalent to the following, involving *probability functions*:

- **Discrete RVs**: Independence $\iff$ $p(x,y)=p_{X}(x)p_{Y}(y)$

- **Continuous RVs**: Independence $\iff$ $f(x,y)=f_{X}(x)f_{Y}(y)$

# Practice

- $f_{2}(y_{2})=6y_{2}(1-y_{2}),\ 0\leq y_{2}\leq 1$

Then $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ are independent if and only if $$f(y_{1},y_{2})=g(y_{1})h(y_{2}),$$ where $g(y_{1})$ is a nonnegative function of $y_{1}$ *alone* and $h(y_{2})$ is a nonnegative function of $y_{2}$ *alone*. 

- In some cases, we don't need to derive marginal densities to prove independence! We just need to break the joint density function into separate pieces involving $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ alone. 

---

# Example

Suppose $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ denote the lengths of life, in hundreds of hours, for components of types I and II, respectively, in an electronic system. The joint density of $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ is $$f(y_{1},y_{2})=\begin{cases}(1/8)y_{1}e^{-(y_{1}+y_{2})/2},& y_{1}>0, y_{2}>0,\\0,&\text{elsewhere}.\end{cases}$$

- Using the previous theorem, prove that $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ are independent. 

--

**Solution**: $f(y_{1},y_{2})=g(y_{1})h(y_{2})$, where...

- $g(y_{1})=(1/8)y_{1}e^{-y_{1}/2}$

- $h(y_{2})=e^{-y_{2}/2}$

**Discrete**

Let $g(Y_{1},Y_{2},\dots,Y_{k})$ be a function of discrete RVs with joint probability function $p(y_{1},y_{2},\dots,y_{k})$. Then the **expected value** of $g(Y_{1},Y_{2},\dots,Y_{k})$ is $$E[g(Y_{1},Y_{2},\dots,Y_{k})]=\sum_{y_{k}}\cdots\sum_{y_{2}}\sum_{y_{1}}g(y_{1},y_{2},\dots,y_{k})p(y_{1},y_{2},\dots,y_{k}).$$

**Continuous**

If $Y_{1},Y_{2},\dots,Y_{k}$ are continuous RVs with joint density function $f(y_{1},y_{2},\dots,y_{k})$, then $$E[g(Y_{1},Y_{2},\dots,Y_{k})]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\cdots\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(y_{1},y_{2},\dots,y_{k})f(y_{1},y_{2},\dots,y_{k})\,dy_{1}dy_{2}\dots dy_{k}.$$

# Two Simple Tricks ™️

**Theorems**

1. Let $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ be random variables and $g_{1}(Y_{1},Y_{2}),g_{2}(Y_{1},Y_{2}),\dots,g_{k}(Y_{1},Y_{2})$ be functions of $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$. Then 
\begin{align*}
& E[g_{1}(Y_{1},Y_{2})+g_{2}(Y_{1},Y_{2})+\cdots+g_{k}(Y_{1},Y_{2})]\\
&\ \ \ \ =E[g_{1}(Y_{1},Y_{2})]+E[g_{2}(Y_{1},Y_{2})]+\cdots+E[g_{k}(Y_{1},Y_{2})]
\end{align*}

2. Let $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ be **independent** random variables and $g(Y_{1})$ and $h(Y_{2})$ be functions of *only* $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$, respectively. Then $$E[g(Y_{1})h(Y_{2})]=E[g(Y_{1})]E[h(Y_{2})],$$ provided that the expectations exist.

# Practice

(WMS 5.81)

Suppose $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ denote the lengths of life, in hundreds of hours, for components of types I and II, respectively, in an electronic system. The joint density of $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ is $$f(y_{1},y_{2})=\begin{cases}(1/8)y_{1}e^{-(y_{1}+y_{2})/2},& y_{1}>0, y_{2}>0,\\0,&\text{elsewhere}.\end{cases}$$

One way to measure the relative efficiency of the two components is to compute the ratio $Y_{2}/Y_{1}$. Find $E(Y_{2}/Y_{1})$. 

- **Hint**: Use the fact that $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ are *independent*. The *Gamma* and *Exponential* PDFs will also help!

Because $X$ and $Y$ don't really have any relationship in *either* direction...

- $X-E(X)$ and $Y-E(Y)$ with have the **same** sign for some points, and the **opposite** sign for others
    - This means that $(X-E(X))(Y-E(Y))$ will average to (approx.) zero. 

--

This implies that the **covariance** between $X$ and $Y$ will be near zero!

---

# Covariance

If $X$ and $Y$ are random variables with means $\mu_{X}$ and $\mu_{Y}$, respectively, the **covariance** of $X$ and $Y$ is $$Cov(X,Y)=E[(X-\mu_{X})(Y-\mu_{Y})]=E(XY)-E(X)E(Y).$$

--

<br>

We sometimes use the *standardized form* of the covariance, called the **correlation coefficient**: $$\rho=\frac{Cov(X,Y)}{\sigma_{X}\sigma_{Y}},$$ where $\sigma_{X}$ and $\sigma_{Y}$ are the *standard deviations* of $X$ and $Y$. 

- $\rho$ ranges between -1 and +1
    - $\rho=1$ implies a *perfect positive (linear) correlation*
    - $\rho=-1$ implies a *perfect negative (linear) correlation*

---

# Practice

Suppose that $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ are jointly continuous with PDF given by $$f(y_{1},y_{2})=\begin{cases}4y_{1}y_{2},&0\leq y_{1}\leq 1,0\leq y_{2}\leq 1,\\0,&\text{elsewhere.}\end{cases}$$

Find $Cov(Y_{1},Y_{2})$. 

> Is this result surprising? Why or why not?

---

# Covariance and Independence

**Theorem**

If $X$ and $Y$ are **independent** random variables, then $$Cov(X,Y)=0.$$ Thus, the variables must be *uncorrelated*.

--

🚨🚨The *converse* is not true!!!🚨🚨

- If $Cov(X,Y)=0$, then $X$ and $Y$ are *not necessarily* independent!

--

**Example**

Let $X\sim\text{Normal}(0, 1)$ and $Y=X^{2}$. Prove that $Cov(X,Y)=0$ but $X$ and $Y$ are **not** independent. 

- We'll use the fact that $\text{Skew}(X)=0$ for a $\text{Normal}(0,1)$ distribution. 

---

# Covariance in R

Let's simulate $X$ and $Y$ from the previous example!

```{r}
X = rnorm(10000)
Y = X^2
data = data.frame(X, Y)

Using the `cov()` function on a *data frame* will produce a **covariance matrix**:

```{r}
cov(data)

# Linear Functions of Random Variables

For random variables $Y_{1},Y_{2},\dots,Y_{n}$ and constants $a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n}$, a **linear function** of the $Y_{i}$ random variables is: $$U_{1}=a_{1}Y_{1}+a_{2}Y_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}Y_{n}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}Y_{i}$$

Let $Y_{1}, Y_{2},\dots,Y_{n}$ and $X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{m}$ be random varibles with $E(Y_{i})=\mu_{i}$ and $E(X_{i})=\xi_{i}$. Define $$U_{1}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}Y_{i}\quad\text{and}\quad U_{2}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}b_{j}X_{j}$$ for constants $a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n}$ and $b_{1},b_{2},\dots,b_{m}$. Then:

1. $E(U_{1})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}E(Y_{i})$

2. $Var(U_{1})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}^{2}Var(Y_{i})+2\sum\sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n}a_{i}a_{j}Cov(Y_{i},Y_{j})$, where the double sum is over all pairs $(i,j)$ with $i<j$. 

3. $Cov(U_{1},U_{2})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{i}b_{j}Cov(Y_{i},X_{j})$

# Hypergeometric Variance

First, represent $Y$ as a sum of **indicator variables**, $$Y=I_{1}+\cdots+I_{n},$$ where $I_{j}$ is the indicator of the $j$th toy in the sample being red ( $I_{j}=1$ if red, $I_{j}=0$ if blue). 

- For each $I_{j}$, $E(I_{j})=r/N$, which we'll define as $p$. 
    - Therefore, $Var(I_{j})=p(1-p)$ if we think of the $I_{j}$ as *Bernoulli* trials.

Therefore, 

\begin{align*}
Var(Y)&=Var\left(\sum_{j=1}^{n}I_{j}\right)\\
&=Var(I_{1})+\cdots+Var(I_{n})+2\sum_{i<j}Cov(I_{i},I_{j})\\
&=np(1-p)+2\binom{n}{2}Cov(I_{1},I_{2}),
\end{align*}

since there are $\binom{n}{2}$ combinations of $I_{i}$ and $I_{j}$, and the covariance between each of the pairs is the same. 

---

# Hypergeometric Variance

For $Cov(I_{1},I_{2})$, use the following:

\begin{align*}
Cov(I_{1},I_{2})&=E(I_{1}I_{2})-E(I_{1})E(I_{2})\\
&=P(\text{1st and 2nd toys are both red})-P(\text{1st toy red})P(\text{2nd toy red})\\
&=\left(\frac{r}{N}\right)\left(\frac{r-1}{N-1}\right)-p^{2}
\end{align*}

--

Plugging this in for $Cov(I_{1},I_{2})$, the variance simplifies to: $$Var(Y)=np(1-p)\left(\frac{N-n}{N-1}\right)$$

- The $\frac{N-n}{N-1}$ is known as a **finite population correction**, and adjusts the *binomial variance* for the fact that we are now sampling *without replacement*.

# Binomial-Poisson Hierarchy

An insect lays a large number of eggs, each surviving with probability $p$. Let $X=$ the number of eggs that survived, and $Y=$ the number of eggs laid. 

Assuming that each egg's survival is independent from the next, we can treat them as *Bernoulli* trials with survival probability $p$, so the total number of survivors out of $Y$ eggs laid is **binomial**. 

- We model $Y$ with a $Poisson(\lambda)$ distribution to reflect the variability in eggs laid across litters from the same mother.
